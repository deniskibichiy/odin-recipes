   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This sambusa recipe is my version of a Somali dish that I learned by watching friends around Ramadan. These sambusas are really good, and I can't stop eating them. They are served during Ramadan, weddings, parties, or just because. Since I am married to a Somalian man, I learned to cook a few things, and there are some of my American dishes he loves as well.</p>
