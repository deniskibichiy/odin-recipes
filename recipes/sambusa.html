   <h1>Sambusa</h1>

   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p class="description">This sambusa recipe is my version of a Somali dish that I learned by watching friends around Ramadan. These sambusas are really good, and I can't stop eating them. They are served during Ramadan, weddings, parties, or just because. Since I am married to a Somalian man, I learned to cook a few things, and there are some of my American dishes he loves as well.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul class="description">
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 leek, chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) package spring roll wrappers</li>
    <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol class="steps">
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, leek, and garlic in hot oil until onion is transparent. Add ground beef; cook and stir until still slightly pink and about halfway done. Season with cumin, cardamom, salt, and pepper; mix well. Continue cooking until beef is browned and crumbly. Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
    <li>Mix together flour and water in a small bowl to make a thin paste. Using one wrapper at a time, fold into the shape of a cone. Fill cone with beef mixture, close the top, and seal with paste. Repeat until wrappers or filling are used up.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (170 degrees C). There should be enough oil to submerge sambusas. Fry sambusas, a few at a time, in hot oil until golden brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
